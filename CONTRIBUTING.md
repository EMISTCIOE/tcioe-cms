## 🧾 Commit Guidelines

### 🔐 Commit Message Format

Use: `type(scope): message`

**Types:**

- `fix`: Bug fix
- `feat`: New feature
- `docs`: Documentation update
- `style`: Code formatting only
- `test`: Adding or fixing tests
- `chore`: Tooling or configuration
- `refactor`: Code restructuring without behavior changes

**Examples:**

- `feat: add dark mode toggle`
- `style: fix header alignment`
- `fix: handle error in form submission`
- `test: add unit tests for user service`
- `docs: update README with setup instructions`
- `refactor: simplify user authentication logic`
- `chore: update dependencies to latest versions`

---

### ✨ Linting, Formatting & Type Safety

We use `eslint`, `prettier`, and `typescript` to ensure quality and consistency.

**Pre-commit automatically runs:**

- `yarn lint-staged` — lint & format staged files

**You can run manually anytime:**

- `yarn format` — format entire codebase
- `yarn lint-staged` — lint & format changed files
- `yarn lint` — full eslint scan

Fix all issues before committing.
